      abstract="Message-passing graph neural networks (MPNNs) emerged as powerful tools for processing graph-structured input. However, they operate on a fixed input graph structure, ignoring potential noise and missing information. Furthermore, their local aggregation mechanism can lead to problems such as over-squashing and limited expressive power in capturing relevant graph structures. Existing solutions to these challenges have primarily relied on heuristic methods, often disregarding the underlying data distribution. Hence, devising principled approaches for learning to infer graph structures relevant to the given prediction task remains an open challenge. In this work, leveraging recent progress in exact and differentiable k-subset sampling, we devise probabilistically rewired MPNNs (PR-MPNNs), which learn to add relevant edges while omitting less beneficial ones. For the first time, our theoretical analysis explores how PR-MPNNs enhance expressive power, and we identify precise conditions under which they outperform purely randomized approaches. Empirically, we demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates issues like over-squashing and under-reaching. In addition, on established real-world datasets, our method exhibits competitive or superior predictive performance compared to traditional MPNN models and recent graph transformer architectures. ",

    abstract = "Deep learning models have reignited the interest in Anomaly Detection research in recent years. Methods for Anomaly Detection in text have shown strong empirical results on ad-hoc anomaly setups that are usually made by downsampling some classes of a labeled dataset. This can lead to reproducibility issues and models that are biased toward detecting particular anomalies while failing to recognize them in more sophisticated scenarios. In the present work, we provide a unified benchmark for detecting various types of anomalies, focusing on problems that can be naturally formulated as Anomaly Detection in text, ranging from syntax to stylistics. In this way, we are hoping to facilitate research in Text Anomaly Detection. We also evaluate and analyze two strong shallow baselines, as well as two of the current state-of-the-art neural approaches, providing insights into the knowledge the neural models are learning when performing the anomaly detection task. We provide the code for evaluation, downloading, and preprocessing the dataset at https://github.com/mateibejan1/ad-nlp/.",

    abstract = "Leveraging deep learning models for Anomaly Detection (AD) has seen widespread use in recent years due to superior performances over traditional methods. Recent deep methods for anomalies in images learn better features of normality in an end-to-end self-supervised setting. These methods train a model to discriminate between different transformations applied to visual data and then use the output to compute an anomaly score. We use this approach for AD in text, by introducing a novel pretext task on text sequences. We learn our DATE model end-to-end, enforcing two independent and complementary self-supervision signals, one at the token-level and one at the sequence-level. Under this new task formulation, we show strong quantitative and qualitative results on the 20Newsgroups and AG News datasets. In the semi-supervised setting, we outperform state-of-the-art results by +13.5{\%} and +6.9{\%}, respectively (AUROC). In the unsupervised configuration, DATE surpasses all other methods even when 10{\%} of its training data is contaminated with outliers (compared with 0{\%} for the others).",
