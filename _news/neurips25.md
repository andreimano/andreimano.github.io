Our paper, [Learning (Approximately) Equivariant Networks via Constrained Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13631) has been accepted as an Oral ðŸ“¢ at NeurIPS 2025! I will also be presenting the paper at the NeurIPS [NPGML](https://newgraphperspectives.com/) workshop and at the [COML](https://constrained-opt-ml.github.io/) workshop.
