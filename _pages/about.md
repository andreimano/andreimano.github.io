Hi there 👋! I'm Andrei, I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the <a href='https://imprs.is.mpg.de/'>International Max Planck Research School for Intelligent Systems</a> and <a href='https://ellis.eu/'>ELLIS</a>, under the co-supervision of <a href='http://matlog.net/index.html'>Mathias Niepert</a> (<a href='https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/en/'>University of Stuttgart</a>) and <a href='https://bsse.ethz.ch/mlcb/karsten/profile-karsten.html'>Karsten Borgwardt</a> (<a href='https://ethz.ch/en.html'>ETH Zürich</a> & <a href='https://www.biochem.mpg.de/en'>MPI-B</a>). I am also a Machine Learning Researcher at <a href='https://bit-ml.github.io/'>Bitdefender's Theoretical Research Laboratory</a>. I got a B.Sc. in Mathematics and a M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence from the <a href='https://fmi.unibuc.ro/'>University of Bucharest</a>. In the past I have also worked as a Software Engineer for <a href='https://www.nxp.com/'>NXP Semiconductors</a>.

My Ph.D. research focuses on the design and development of Geometric Deep Learning methods where the robustness and trustworthiness of such models are an integral part of the research. My Master's thesis involved deep anomaly detection in text (<a href='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreimano/andreimano.github.io/master/msc_thesis_manolache.pdf'>full thesis</a>).
